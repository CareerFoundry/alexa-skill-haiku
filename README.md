# Alexa Skill: Haiku Reader

## Description

Use Alexa to `Ask Haiku Reader` to tell you a haiku, and Alexa will read you a random Haiku.

## Setup

1. On https://developer.amazon.com, create a new Alexa Skill with "Alexa Skill Kit."
2. Use the files from the **speechAssets** to insert an intent schema and sample utterances.
3. Create a new Lambda function using the **index.js** file from the **src** folder.
4. Connect the two and enjoy some silly haikus.
